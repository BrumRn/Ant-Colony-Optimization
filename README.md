# Ant Colony Optimization

### Traveling salesman problem solver using Ant colony optimization

***Ant colony optimization*** is a probabilistic optimization algorithm useful for getting approximative solutions to computational problems. The implementation in this package solves the ***Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem*** given by a weighted adjacency matrix.

### Installation
